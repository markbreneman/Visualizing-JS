This is  project for Visualizing JS, which uses nokogiri to scrape Kickstarter, for projects per city, but status of funding or successfully funded, and attempts to visualize, "where the money's at" with a force directed graph.

This project builds on this simple kickstarter API
https://github.com/redronin/kickstarter
with the additions of cities and funding states.
